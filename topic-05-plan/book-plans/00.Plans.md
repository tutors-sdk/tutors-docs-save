# Values

Tutors is a set open source components & services supporting the design, publication, consumption and monitoring of engaging rich media web based learning resources. The ***Learner Experience*** prioritises **contextual**, **linkable**, **accessible** and **responsive** resources. The ***Educator Experience*** prioritises **autonomy**, **structurally alignment**, **composability**,  **versioning** and **independence**.

### Learner Experience (LX)

1. **Contextual**: Course content should be presented with suitable learning related context. This includes:

   - Appropriate visual cues. It should be apparent from any screen how the current learning object  relates to other course content, including hierarchical and schedule oriented indicators.

   - Navigation mechanics: suitable navigations feature should enable the student to reach related learning content, implicitly understanding its context.

   - Transitions & Animations: moving within a course should reinforce this contextual awareness

2. **Linkable**: All meaningful learning objects should be capable of being bookmarked, These links should be:
   - and these bookmarks should be all that is required for the course to be rebuilt in another browser session.
3. **Accessible**: Learning resources should support best in class accessibility, including specific attention to:
   - Dyslexia
   - Colour blindness 
   - Visual Impairment
4. **Responsive**: Learning material should adapt adequately from the full range of

### Educator Experience (EX)

1. **Autonomy**: The educator should not be bound to specific services provided by the tutors development team. All learning resources should be capable of being self hosted (educators personal Netlify, Vercel of other suitable service). Where services are availed of by a course (tutors time and live for example), these can be disabled or self hosted via specific instructions for configuring these services independently.

2. **Content Alignment**: when composing a course, the structure of the content should mirror the context and the user experience.

3. **Composable**: Learning resources should be composable - it should straightforward to construct courses from elements of other courses and combine courses into programmes and other configurations.

4. **Versionable**: It should be possible to place a course under git based version control, supporting rollback, branch previews and other version management conveniences.

5. **Independence**: It should be possible for an educator to migrate from the tutors projects to other comparable systems within the static site generator category of tools.
