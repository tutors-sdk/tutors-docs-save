# Values

*Tutors is a set open source components & services supporting the design, publication, consumption and monitoring of engaging, rich media, web based learning resources.* 

The ***Learner Experience*** prioritises the consumption of learning objects  that are **contextual**, **linkable**, **searchable**, **accessible** and **responsive** resources. 

The ***Educator Experience*** prioritises supports the creation of learning objects that are **autonomous**, **structurally aligned**, **composable**,  **auditable**, **extensible**, **versioned** and **independent**.

### Learner Experience (LX)

**Contextual**: Suitable navigation features should enable the Learner to visually explore learning objects in the appropriate context, easily reach related material, including parent/child, sibling, and schedule oriented indicators + selected external services. Transitions & Animations should subtly enhance this contextual awareness.

**Linkable**: All meaningful learning objects should be capable of being bookmarked. If these links are sent to another browser session the link should enable the complete learning context to be rebuilt in that session.

**Searchable**: A tutors course should support full text search + filter/summary views.  

**Accessible**: Learning resources should support best in class accessibility, including : dyslexia, colour blindness and visual impairment.

**Responsive**: Learning material should adapt adequately from the full range of device characteristics and orientations from mobile phones to widescreen workstations.

### Educator Experience (EX)

**Autonomous**: Learning resources should be capable of being self hosted, independent of any tutors cloud services.

**Structurally Aligned**: The structure Learning content should mirror the layout and sequencing of the desired learning experience.

**Composable**: It should straightforward to construct courses from elements of other courses and combine courses into programmes and other configurations.

**Auditable** It should be possible to ascertain whether students have engaged with specific learning resources.

**Extensible**: It should be possible to introduce new, parallel learning services within a family of tutors tools

**Versioned**: It should be possible to place a course under git based version control, supporting rollback, branch previews and other version management conveniences.

**Independent**: It should be possible for an educator to migrate from the tutors projects to other comparable systems within the static site generator category of tools.
