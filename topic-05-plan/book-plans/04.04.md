# Generators

These tools are used to harvest a tutors course folder, for instance this example course here:

- <https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-starter>

... and transform the contents into web experience. If using a system such as Netlify, the process is [documented here](https://reader.tutors.dev/#/lab/tutors-docs.netlify.app/topic-01-create/unit-1/book-a/Netlify). The generators can also be run from the command line:

~~~bash
npx tutors-json
~~~

~~~bash
npx tutors-html
~~~

These will generate, respectively:

- A JSON encapsulation of the course, suitable for publication on a CDN based edge distribution platform (Netlify, Vercel)

- A static site, browsable locally.

These are generated into the `public-site` and `json` folders inside the project folder.

### tutors-lib

This is the tutors course parser, packaged as a reusable component:

- <https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-lib>

This abstracts the course structure, constructing a traversable, recursive data structure comparable to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for the course

### tutors-json

This is the JSON generator:

- <https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-json>

This will use `tutors-lib` to parse a course, traverse the generated AST and emit the JSON course.

### tutors-html

This site the HTML generator:

- <https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-html>

It will also use `tutors-lib` to generate a static site
